# Cursor Rules for Virtual Fitting Room Project

## Project Architecture
- **Hybrid Architecture**: "Front Store, Back Factory" (前店後廠).
- **Primary Environment (Windows)**: RTX 4090 / CUDA. Core environment for AI generation (3D Body & Objects). 100x faster than Mac MPS.
- **Auxiliary Environment (Mac)**: M4 / MPS. Used for mobile development, UI/UX demo, and remote coding.
- **Backend**: FastAPI (Python 3.11).
- **Frontend**: React + Three.js.

## Development Guidelines
- Always prioritize **relative paths** using `Path(__file__)` or `os.path`.
- Backend outputs should be saved in `backend/outputs/` and served via `/outputs` mount.
- Frontend configuration is located in `frontend/src/config/index.ts`.
- AI logic is encapsulated in `backend/body_service.py` (Singleton pattern).
- Factory logic is located in `clothing-factory/sam-3d-objects/`.

## Hardware Optimization
- **Mac**: Use **MPS** (Metal Performance Shaders) for torch.
- **Windows**: Use **CUDA** (NVIDIA RTX 4090).
- Use `device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cpu"`.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Always use `pathlib.Path` or `os.path.join` for file paths to support both `\` (Windows) and `/` (Mac).
- Python 3.11 is the standard across all platforms.
- For Windows, assume environments managed by **Conda**.
- For Mac, assume environments managed by **venv**.

## Windows Development (Clothing Factory)
- When working in `clothing-factory/`, assume **PowerShell** or **WSL2**.
- Focus on **CUDA** compatibility and **PyTorch3D** specific issues.
- Outputs should target `frontend/public/models/` for easy sharing.

## File Naming Conventions
- Generated bodies: `{image_name}_body_{index}.obj`
- Generated clothes: `{image_name}_cloth_{index}.obj`

## Documentation & Maintenance
- **Keep Logs Updated**: After every significant milestone or environment change, update `PROJECT_DEVELOPMENT_LOG.md`.
- **Sync Troubleshooting**: Add new errors and solutions to `SETUP_TROUBLESHOOTING.md` immediately after resolving them.
- **Maintain README**: Ensure `README.md` reflects the current setup steps and architecture.
- **Chinese Response**: Always respond in Traditional Chinese (繁體中文).
