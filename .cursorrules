# Cursor Rules for Virtual Fitting Room Project

## Project Architecture
- **Hybrid Architecture**: "Front Store, Back Factory" (前店後廠).
- **Backend (Mac)**: FastAPI, SAM 3D Body (MPS/CPU).
- **Frontend (Mac)**: React, Three.js, Vite.
- **Factory (Windows)**: SAM 3D Objects (CUDA).

## Development Guidelines
- Always prioritize **relative paths** using `Path(__file__)` or `os.path`.
- Backend outputs should be saved in `backend/outputs/` and served via `/outputs` mount.
- Frontend configuration is located in `frontend/src/config/index.ts`.
- AI logic is encapsulated in `backend/body_service.py` (Singleton pattern).
- Factory logic is located in `clothing-factory/sam-3d-objects/`.

## Hardware Optimization
- **Mac**: Use **MPS** (Metal Performance Shaders) for torch.
- **Windows**: Use **CUDA** (NVIDIA RTX 4090).
- Use `device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "mps" if torch.backends.mps.is_available() else "cpu"`.

## Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Always use `pathlib.Path` or `os.path.join` for file paths to support both `\` (Windows) and `/` (Mac).
- Python 3.11 is the standard across all platforms.
- For Windows, assume environments managed by **Conda**.
- For Mac, assume environments managed by **venv**.

## Windows Development (Clothing Factory)
- When working in `clothing-factory/`, assume **PowerShell** or **WSL2**.
- Focus on **CUDA** compatibility and **PyTorch3D** specific issues.
- Outputs should target `frontend/public/models/` for easy sharing.

## File Naming Conventions
- Generated bodies: `{image_name}_body_{index}.obj`
- Generated clothes: `{image_name}_cloth_{index}.obj`
